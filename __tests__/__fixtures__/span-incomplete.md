```js tab={"span":2}
console.log('this is first a codeblock');
```

```js
console.log('this is second a codeblock');
```

```js tab={"span":3}
console.log('this is first a codeblock');
```

```js
console.log('this is second a codeblock');
```

Third codeblock went missing.

```ts tab={"span":2}
console.log('this is a code ');
```
