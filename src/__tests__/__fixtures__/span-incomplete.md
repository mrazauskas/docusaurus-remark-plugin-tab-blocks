```js tab={"span":2}
console.log("this is first a codeblock");
```

```js
console.log("this is second a codeblock");
```

```js
console.log("and one more codeblock");
```

```js tab={"span":3}
console.log("this is first a codeblock");
```

```js
console.log("this is second a codeblock");
```

Third codeblock went missing. That can happen during development.

```ts tab={"span":2}
console.log("this is a code ");
```
